Task 1 is Mobile App Signup Flow, the name of my app is Mindful Breathing. Mindful Breathing is a mobile app designed to help users manage stress through guided breathing exercises. I created wireframes and prototypes in Figma, streamlined the user flow for efficiency, and focused on accessibility to make signup quick and intuitive. This project taught me the importance of frictionless onboarding, ensuring users can start benefiting from the app with minimal effort.
