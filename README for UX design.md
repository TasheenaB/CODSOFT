This project taught me the importance of frictionless onboarding, ensuring users can start benefiting from the app with minimal effort.

This project emphasized the importance of clear hierarchy and visual appeal, making business communication both efficient and engaging.
Task 3 is Restaurant menu, the name of my app is Royalty Seafood Restaurant. Royalty Seafood Restaurant is a menu designed to help customers easily find dishes while encouraging higher-order values. I created an intuitive menu layout in Figma, optimized food categorization for quick navigation, and used visual hierarchy to highlight popular and high-margin items. This project reinforced the importance of user-friendly design and strategic placement, ensuring a smooth ordering experience while driving sales.
